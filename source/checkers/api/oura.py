    This class is only compatible with data stored by the API as 'documents'.

    Datatypes that are not stored like this have to be handled by a different checker.

    {
        "collections": [],  # List of modality names, as defined by the OuraAPI to pull documents for
        "patients": {       # Dictionary of patient IDs and the API keys needed to access that patient's data

    Other Settings:
      - look_back_duration: (optional) pandas frequency string, defines how far back from the current date to look for
      new documents. By default, this is 14D, since the OuraRing can store up to two weeks of data locally.
      - today: (optional) pandas date defining the current date, mainly used for testing purposes. Leave as None to use
      the real current date.
      - api_url: (optional) the full URL needed to access the OuraRing REST API.
